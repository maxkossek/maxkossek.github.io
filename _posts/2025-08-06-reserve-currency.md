Whether you think reserve currency status benefits a country (e.g., USA) depends primarily on whether you focus on consumption vs production, as well as the short-term vs long-term. Almost all supposed benefits of being the reserve currency come with real trade-offs. Other supposed benefits--like lower interest rates--are misattributed to reserve currency status.

The benefits of reserve currency status are mainly short-term: being able to run persistent currenct account deficits by issuing liabilities denominated in the reserve currency (e.g., dollars). This gives other nations a claim to real goods or assets in the future. Capital inflows benefits the financial sector by increasing asset prices, but come at the cost of productive investment in tradable sectors and industrial capacity. Demand for dollars leads to an appreciation of the dollar's value relative to other currencies. This benefits importers at the cost of exporters.

The claim that reserve currency status leads to lower borrowing costs both reverses causality and misunderstands that the central bank in a country with floating exchange rates can control interest rates. In fact, the central bank could engage in direct money printing to fund its spending. This would avoid the issuance of debt instruments entirely. Even within current legal constrains, the central bank has plenty of tools, such as yield curve control (YCC), to control both short- and long-term interest rates. The argument is also not supported empirically: the U.S. has had higher interest rates than many other countries such as Switzerland.

The main benefit of reserve currency status is the control and leverage it provides in global finance. It gives the USA power to impose extraterritorial sanctions and conduct global financial surveillance. However, over-reliance and weaponization of these tools undermines the stability required for currency to act as reserve currency and gives an incentive for other countries to circumvent these restrictions and reduce reliance on the reserve currency (e.g., to de-dedollarize) over time. Sanctions specifically have had limited efficacy and impose high costs. A retrenchment in USA foreign policy would reduce the influence of the foreign policy establishment to lobby for the continued use of these controls.
