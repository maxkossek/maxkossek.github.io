Sports where the top dog almost always wins have low variance; sports where the underdog has a higher chance of winning have higher variance. Examples of high variance sports include ice hockey, soccer, and baseball. Low variance sports include tennis, weightlifting, Formula 1, track and field, weightlifting, and chess.

You can measure performance or skill based on win-to-loss variance or probability (odds in sports betting). The rules of the league and the sport can be adjusted to increase or decrease the variance, even within the same sport. For example, March Madness (single-elimination) has much higher variance than NBA Playoffs (Best of 7). In general, these are factors that increase variance:

- Longer games
- More games
- More scoring
- Common equipment or vehicles
- Smaller field size
- Team sports (as opposed to individual sports)
- Sports affected by weather conditions (that is, outdoor sports)
- Sports that measure performance by close proxies of speed, endurance, or strength (for example, most track and field events)
