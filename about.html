<p>I'm a quantitative researcher with an interesting economics and policy design. I currently work at America First Policy Institute's Office for Fiscal and Regulatory Analysis. Besides fiscal policy analysis, I've also worked on strategic trade controls (export controls, sanctions, investment controls), supercomputing, and emerging technology. My university training is in computer science and mathematics.</p>

<p>My goal is to design policies and technologies that benefit Americans. I prefer innovative and approaches unconstrained by bureaucracy, institutional inertia, and entrenched interests. Feel free to reach out with any questions or requests.</p>
